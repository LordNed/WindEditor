WindEditor
==========

Remade version of WindViewer.

It's more broken than WindViewer, which is more broken than the original. I've created a never ending spiral of broken-ness!

There's some [test content to play around with](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/813382/WindViewer_TestContent.7z) floating around on a Dropbox that is not ours.
